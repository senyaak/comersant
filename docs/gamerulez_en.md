### Completing a Lap and Dividends

When completing a **full lap**, a player receives **dividends (profit)** from all their enterprises in the amount indicated on the card.

- Profit increases proportionally to the money invested in the enterprise
- Dividends are paid when completing a "full" lap (outer and inner)

## Landing on Spaces

### Landing on an Unowned Lot

When a player's piece lands on an **unowned lot** with an enterprise:

1. The player can **purchase** it at the price indicated on the card
2. Money is paid to the **Bank**
3. The Banker gives the player a **"Property" card** identical to the acquired lot

**If purchase is declined**: the Banker has the right to sell the lot to other players at a negotiated price (highest bidder), but **not less than** the price indicated on the card.

### Landing on an Owned Lot

If a player's piece lands on a lot owned by another player, they must **pay the owner rent** according to the card:

- **Area (A)**: base rent
- **Office (O)**: increased rent
- **Department (D)**: significantly higher rent
- **Enterprise (E)**: maximum rent

**Exception**: If the group is incomplete or the enterprise is mortgaged, rent is **not charged**.

### "Letter," "Risk," "Surprise" Spaces

The player takes the top card from the corresponding deck (placed face down), performs the operations specified on the card, and places it at the **bottom of the deck**.

### "Vacation," "Treatment" Spaces

The player **skips their turn**.

## Enterprise Groups and Development

### Enterprise Groups

All enterprises are divided into **groups of the same color** with **three in each**:
- Stores
- Food Service
- Theaters
- And others

### Main Objective of the Game

Acquire property, preferably **by color group**, and then purchase on these lots:
1. **Office**
2. **Department**
3. **Head Enterprise**

To own them and collect rent from opponents.

### Complete Group Advantage

A player owning **three lots of the same color** charges a player landing on their property **double rent**.

**Triple rent** is charged when owning:
- **"Statefarm,"** AND
- **Three lots of the same color** from the group:
  - "Food Product Trade"
  - "Public Catering"
  - "Agricultural Product Sales"

### Enterprise Development

After purchasing **all three lots of the same color**, the player begins to develop the property:

**Development Sequence** (on each lot):
1. Purchase **Office (O)**
2. Purchase **Department (D)**
3. Purchase **Enterprise (E)**

**Important Rule**: Property is acquired **evenly**.

**Example of Improper Development**:
A player CANNOT purchase an enterprise on one lot if other lots in the same group have only an office or department.

**In one turn**, a player can place **only one** office, department, or enterprise on one lot.

### Development Example: "Grocery Store"

1. **Lot Purchase**: 30,000 rubles
2. **Office**: +20,000 rubles (marker "O" is placed)
3. **Department**: +20,000 rubles (marker "D" is placed)
4. **Enterprise**: +20,000 rubles (marker "E" is placed)

**Rent when opponent lands**:
- Area (A): 4,000 rubles
- Office (O): 12,000 rubles
- Department (D): 50,000 rubles
- Enterprise (E): 120,000 rubles

**Dividends when completing a lap**:
- For example, if you own an office: 1,200 rubles
- Profit is summed across all enterprises

---

## State-Owned Enterprises

The game includes **six state-owned enterprises**, marked with the letter **"S"** (State).

### How to Purchase a State Enterprise

Requirements:
1. Have a **red token** (obtained by landing on a space with a token placed nearby)
2. Land on a **"State Enterprise"** space

### State Enterprise Features

- **Purchase price is higher** than regular enterprises
- **Does not require** acquiring three lots of the same color
- **Rent from other players is higher**
- Purchase follows the same sequence: **Office → Department → Enterprise**

### Trading Red Tokens

If a player doesn't have a red token but another player does, the **token can be purchased** at a negotiated price.

---

## Vacant Land Lot

The board has spaces for **"Vacant Land Lot"** with the price indicated.

**Opportunities**:
- Upon landing, a player can **purchase** the lot
- Opponents are charged **rent** when landing on this lot
- The lot can be **sold** to other players at any time at a negotiated price

---

## Raccito

The board has **four "Raccito" spaces**.

### Raccito Advantages

When landing on a "Raccito" space, a player can **optionally** become a racketeer and gain advantages:

- When landing on **another player's lot**: not only **does not pay** the owner, but also **takes** from them half the cost of the office or enterprise at the stage at which it was purchased

### Protection from Raccito

The "Risk" deck contains **four cards** marked **"Your enterprises are under police protection"**.

A player who receives this card keeps it, and when a racketeer lands on their property:
- The racketeer has all **cash confiscated** by the bank (excluding real estate)

### Special Raccito Rules

- The racketeer marks their piece or the banker makes notes
- The racketeer can cease "activities" only after completing **at least two full laps** of the game
- The racketeer conducts any buying and selling operations

---

## Loans

When temporarily short of funds, a player has the right to take a **loan** from the bank.

### Loan Terms

- **Maximum amount**: 100,000 rubles
- **Repayment period**: no later than **three laps**
- **Interest**: 20% of the loan amount
- **Early repayment** is possible in installments with mandatory interest payment

### Purpose of Loan

A loan is taken when purchasing property if there is a shortage of cash at the moment.

---

## Property Trading and Mortgaging

### Trading

A player should strive to purchase all offices, departments, and enterprises of a color group as quickly as possible.

**Trading Rules**:
- Transactions are conducted **before the player's turn**
- Purchase or sale of lots occurs **by agreement** with the bank and other players
- A lot **CANNOT be sold** or exchanged if an office, department, or enterprise is already built on it

### Mortgage

Done by turning the "Property" card face down.

**Mortgage Terms**:
- Mortgaged **only to the bank**
- At **half the price** of the cost
- When an enterprise is mortgaged, rent from opponents is **not charged**

**Selling to the Bank**:
- An enterprise is sold to the bank at **full price**

### Selling Offices and Departments

If short of money, a player can **sell** an office or enterprise, but **evenly** removing them from lots (following the principle of even development).

---

## Penalties and Violations

### Player Penalties

**Fine of 2,000 rubles** is paid to the bank if a player:
- Moved another player's piece, OR
- Did not fully pay an opponent

### Banker Penalty

A banker caught in **dishonest operations** with bank money or personal funds:
- Must **stop playing**
- Their property becomes **ownerless** and re-enters the game
- A **new bank manager** is chosen to continue the game

---

## Bankruptcy and Game End

Players unable to make financial transactions with the bank or opponents at any given moment (**bankrupts**) are **eliminated from the game**.

### Victory

The **winner** is the player with the **most property and cash** at the end of the game.

---

## Additional Notes

1. **Card Transfer**: When purchasing a lot, the "Enterprise" card is transferred to the owner, as well as the "Land Lot" and "State Enterprise" cards

2. **Voluntary Raccito**: When landing on a "Raccito" space, the raccito rule does not necessarily apply to the player — it depends on their choice

3. **"Property" Card**: Certifies the player's right to own the lot and further construction of an office, department, and head enterprise on it
